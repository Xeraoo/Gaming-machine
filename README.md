# Game Console Project

Welcome to my **Game Console** project, which marks the beginning of my programming journey. This is my first major programming project, developed as part of my learning process. The project consists of a console-based game system featuring three different games: **Snake Game**, **T-Rex Runner**, and **Guessing Game**. I created this project using **C++** and included simple console graphics and sound effects to enhance the user experience.

## Features
- **Snake Game**: A classic snake game where the player controls a snake to eat items and grow, while avoiding obstacles and itself.
- **T-Rex Runner**: Inspired by the offline game in Google Chrome, where the player controls a running T-Rex and avoids obstacles by jumping.
- **Guessing Game**: A simple number guessing game where the player has to guess a random number generated by the system.

## How It Works
Upon launching the program, the user is presented with a menu to choose one of the three games. Each game has its own set of instructions and mechanics, and the program uses sound effects and colored text to create an engaging experience in the console.

### Games
1. **Snake Game**:
   - Navigate the snake using arrow keys.
   - Avoid walls and your own tail.
   - Grow the snake by eating items that appear on the screen.
2. **T-Rex Runner**:
   - Control the T-Rex by jumping over obstacles.
   - The game speeds up as you progress.
3. **Guessing Game**:
   - The program randomly generates a number.
   - Try to guess the number by entering your guesses.
   - The program provides feedback on whether your guess is too high or too low.

## Technologies Used
- **C++** for core programming.
- **Windows.h** and **mmsystem.h** for console graphics and sound effects.
- Simple console manipulation for positioning and colored text.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++` or Visual Studio).
3. Run the executable from the console.

## Learning Experience
This project is my first substantial experience in programming. While working on it, I learned:
- Basic control structures in C++.
- Console-based graphics and text manipulation.
- Using sound effects in a console application.
- Structuring a multi-game console program.

Feel free to check out the code and experiment with it. As I continue to learn and develop my skills, I plan to extend this project or create new ones!
